girlfriend demi moore and men at work with brother charlie sheen they are lousy films badly acted directed stupid and offensive <UNK> is a good actor but lousy as a director i turned this on in pure <UNK> it has a great cast and i had nothing else to do damned if it didn't pull me in br br it concerns <UNK> coming home from vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there his parents kathy bates martin sheen and sister kimberly williams try to reach him but can't something in vietnam has affected him deeply and he's about to explode br br a bit overlong but still very good a lot of the material is <UNK> but the cast is so good that they make it seem new <UNK> is good sheen is terrific and real life father williams is touching and bates is just extraordinary trying to hold the family together it all leads up to a powerful ending which really surprised me br br well worth catching br br","<START> back in the day is an interesting but flawed effort <UNK> rule stars as reggie cooper a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father he meets his old friend j bone <UNK> <UNK> who tries to force reggie into a life of crime reggie also falls in love with ali who is the <UNK> daughter now he has to choose love or crime br br <UNK> rule does a competent job as reggie at least he's trying to act <UNK> <UNK> is perfect as j bone he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role joe morton as the preacher is his usual excellent self but he doesn't do much the same problem for giancarlo esposito as <UNK> dad he needed more screen time i don't want to say this but pam grier is pretty awful as mrs cooper she overacts every scene and brings the movie down tia carrere and frank <UNK> are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot br br in the end you should see it for the skilled performances of <UNK> <UNK> and joe morton and the <UNK> of the writing and directing","s a lot of <UNK> black humor repressed dreams <UNK> dream of fly <UNK> lack of control the relation between <UNK> and no sense parallel stories a <UNK> violence anachronisms and br br a little sign of hope <UNK> in the husband's home return and un mas used for <UNK> motif <UNK> bruno <UNK> is a charming character i think in a way the king without a crown who don't expects for anything but broken noses maria <UNK> the lovable wife put out a lot of faces but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments but you will fall in love of her the <UNK> drag too much woods feeds the lack of technical merits intentional of course out of focus shots close ups in introspective scenes dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts is something difficult to digest it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it it tastes bitter like a rotten orange juice and sour like <UNK> milk but you want to enjoy it so i recommend to get some before the show because you won't get hungry after all","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> this is a black and white film from france br br simple plot gangster on the run seeking getting help etc we have seen this type film many times over the years what makes this film different are mainly its acting style all the actors perform quietly no one yells hardly anyone loses his temper there are quite a few deaths some surprising there are beautiful women as well but no sex scenes no car chases either br br just talking it is so refreshing to listen to people talk here we must read subtitles as well br br the acting is near perfect by all especially the lead played by br br <UNK> ventura in a smaller but vital role jean paul <UNK> these 2 actors were among the best br br i said above the film is flawed there are a few script deficiencies in few spots they are minor the acting is the thing in this movie production is first rate as well br br ratings out of 4 88 points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> since watching the trailer in the little mermaid ii return to the sea dvd i had a feeling that this movie is gonna be great 'cause i am a huge disney fan and guess what i'm right this movie is a very worthy successor to the original classic lady and the tramp br br it tells the story of <UNK> lady and son <UNK> who wants to be wild and free instead of living a life though the movie might not be as good as the first one it has a great moral that you couldn't find anywhere else until you watch it br br i admit that the movie isn't for everyone but those of you who hate it all i can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and i suggest that you shouldn't go see it again but hey it's really an awesome story packed with brilliant animation music and star studded voice talents featuring scott wolf party of five and <UNK> <UNK> charmed so if you haven't seen the movie why standing there go and grab the copy","killed by a salad <UNK> terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in but no a tropical island instead br br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i haven't watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it br br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the <UNK> looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to <UNK> these lines and shoot on a island br br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through br br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

their insignificance years and years before tina turner was singing we don't need another hero br br even the forced <UNK> of the ending is <UNK> done in a dilapidated part of paris and rather chilly bare <UNK> apartment with only the couples love for each other to see them through as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night br br from this it was just a short step to wages of fear and the ultimate in despair br br they don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the u s for that matter they didn't even know how to very much in france then much less now the relentless detail of gesture makes even the of italy look like bad <UNK> which i guess makes <UNK> a kind of <UNK> on speed br

we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse definitely one of his best performances <UNK> <UNK> is also terrific as dr blair a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing's purposes br br the thing is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed although they exist the most notorious being the very low key and at times score by ennio morricone it's not exactly bad but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it's not one of the best works by the legendary composer also due to some with the special effects some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes although nothing of big importance or actually annoying br br when talking about john carpenter's films most people will almost instantly name halloween as his favorite film but personally i would go with the thing as i consider it carpenter's greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made 10 10","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

in our hand like treat we were too young too middle class too invested too much a part of the actions we hated br br but there was a moment as andre gregory observes in my dinner with there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60's and early 70's when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road something not fueled by prisons <UNK> and dick something <UNK> something innocent and critical at once something with dance br br but we missed it like kong bending a the revolution was turned in on itself into sexism racism homophobia and class crushing politics until we got to w treat would have hated w and iraq and the pathological lies if they were in that film then but the moment passed and w was almost inevitable comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken raging bull into children's lives and china shops br br we should have done something more something better but we clearly didn't know what br br now what","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore however it is not an excuse for poor writing it is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical the dialog in this movie was on par with most <UNK> videos shown to fast food staff in training br br i also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it with that being said no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself that was perfect i see better character acting on canadian television br br this movie had a paper thin plot bad acting poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all this simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason if your looking for a quick scare rent anything else even the cable guy was a scarier film after watching this film i think i would have been better off watching a re run on the x files","a underlying plot where boy meets a girl she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband with that said there are no less than 1000 sub plots and character <UNK> that make this plot almost incomprehensible in the first 15 minutes you are <UNK> with so many things and situations that you just stop caring you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like <UNK> feeding on a corpse each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer after a half hour and completely disinterested i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time wash your socks instead","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

back and felt i couldn't take it anymore the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst i've ever scene in my life about one third of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his mighty fight moves i know fight choreography from that era isn't exactly up to par with today's standards but this is ridiculous they don't even try to make it look realistic flash gordon who hardly resembles a fighter uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives guns and other weapons give me a break there's also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water basically every episode has scenes similar to that as for the rest of the episode there's not much else i remember i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago","places not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such <UNK> as le <UNK> three actors gave outstanding performances franz <UNK> piano music soaked in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie br br i only have one problem with <UNK> vision there is a scene in the film where <UNK> made some changes to <UNK> character comparing to the novel in the book the <UNK> she went to reveal herself to walter the young student in the <UNK> who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that she had stopped communicating with him erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him she kept everything inside she did not like to act she was not a <UNK> she loved to watch the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary it tried to make erika sympathetic and of course huppert was heartbreaking but it took the mystery that surrounded her <UNK> did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film","retired air force reserve general at the end of his life stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion which other actors could not bring to the role added to the cast was co star murray hamilton who was also to be featured in the f b i story with stewart and such other well known character actors as richard <UNK> of the later dick van <UNK> show and robert of the thing from another world the 1951 sci fi classic br br billy wilder captures the flavor of the autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation this story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream a box office failure at the time of it's release it has since become one of the great classics of american film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called america's everyman no student of film history should miss seeing this one there have been over 500 000 films since the beginning of motion pictures and this one belongs among the top 500","mocked the boys fear of heights forced him to get on it br br director <UNK> cuts costs steals footage from other films in fact the best scene from <UNK> is a car chase through <UNK> but it was taken from the jean claude van damme action film maximum risk 1996 there are no shocks scares or atmosphere the special effects are terrible the cgi <UNK> looks like it belongs in a computer game has little interaction with any living cast members there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky trying to appear scarred there isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable there is one awful decapitation that's it br br technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable the romanian locations look suitably romanian <UNK> went straight to video it shows with a pretty cheap look feel to it the acting isn't up to much personality bypass victim michael <UNK> makes for the <UNK> of dull heroes br br <UNK> is a crap film it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve a total waste of 90 minutes as far as i'm concerned one to avoid","script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work with br br now despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film it's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy my main gripe with the film again is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didn't it got laughs because it's a b movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendously br br if you don't mind a fun b movie or funny horror film i'd highly recommend see no evil if you are a true enthusiast of the genre i'd wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

is creepier then most horror movies with that last second sparkling eye to me this music video is what you judge all other music videos on you can easily see the ominous influence m j had on early

at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment unable to control how i felt about the scene the acting is outstanding eric why is he not all over movie screens he was really extraordinary his seemingly effortless attempt on the screen <UNK> me in deep visceral ways i thank him in my opinion eric <UNK> is one of the best <UNK> around and i hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he

all camera work can best be described as a <UNK> mess with close up shots where a medium angle would be much better <UNK> walking around and <UNK> the camera every which way absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads well so be it editing is just a butcher job everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder i tend to think it was the latter br br i only made it about three quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off i

of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love or of ourselves i laughed i cried i couldn't stop thinking about it and what more could you ask for from a film really especially a documentary this is an excellent film and one that i highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries stories about families like yours stories about love life parenting loss expectations soul searching yearning wandering through life and finding your way or not","builds slowly but perfectly and what starts out as a seemingly lost identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love loss family and perhaps more importantly our life's work br br i had never heard of louis kahn prior to this film although i was vaguely familiar with some of his work through the words both good and bad of louis <UNK> colleagues you get a very good sense of what <UNK> must have felt as memories are recalled and stories <UNK> sometimes it seemed as though these people were telling <UNK> how to feel about his father as i listened to each recollection my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span

louis <UNK> work tied all the loose ends together nicely for me and hopefully for <UNK> br br i think <UNK> kahn finally found what he was looking for","with good underlying statements and or story lines about half way through he got up and said he couldn't stand watching it any longer it was so predictable and amateurish i agreed but watched to the end the acting was atrocious even for b grade standards the stereotyping also predictable and i feel for the good folks of lake arthur who must've cringed after seeing the film depicting them in such a way no doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world not just the states but really in this day and age i doubt they'd get away with all the ridiculous presented in this i had to double check the date the film was made as their attempts at gimmicky filming of the more gruesome scenes was something i'd expect from a high school student's first attempt at making a film like i'd like to see this film put into the hands of experienced scriptwriters and film makers its an old tale but one that could still pack a punch if dealt with professionally so disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations the soundtrack was probably the only thing i enjoyed","oscar nominated role george cooper also does a good job as the sick and distressed <UNK> mitchell paul kelly gives an eerie portrayal of a bizarre character and steve brodie sam <UNK> jacqueline white and william <UNK> also give strong supporting performances robert ryan ends up being the most talked about performer of the film giving a chilling performance as montgomery and also being nominated for an oscar br br <UNK> has a terrific look director edward does an extraordinary job with the film's execution and cinematographer j roy hunt does a masterful job with its black and white picture picture is as dark and <UNK> as its themes covered in shadow with an almost glossy <UNK> yet also very raw in parts ironically the film's great look was not the result of hard work or even intention wanted to spend more time and money on the actors rather than the lighting so that's what he did less lights less preparation around a 6

scene i think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie that's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end br br the performances are extremely good from all the five female characters these women gave strong intense but believable performances that demonstrate the <UNK> dramatic abilities br br the legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot's difficulty because the legal term of <UNK> is different from a simple raping from the point of view of <UNK> defense <UNK> needs to be <UNK> as a raping a huge crime grade b although it's a

somewhat poorly acted and contrived watch for the cookies carl payne shows that he can carry off a lead role and should be back on television the leading lady can't remember her name sorry was

i mean he was sick sadistic and very cruel the back story between the brothers was good plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die jon <UNK> was pretty good as the goofy best bud of <UNK> i liked how chad kind of cried when he found him dead it was better then just him being like whatever my buddy is dead who cares it showed how he really cared so overall this was a darn god slasher with some great effects bravo","was a chain of short ones i e songs produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the <UNK> steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was i'd go so far to say <UNK> overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve br br it is a very exciting film with editing taking the place of <UNK> of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and there's a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time br br super film which can be <UNK> <UNK> of sound as that's how the finished product would have been conceived 8 10","<UNK> and president grant <UNK> right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and

superior to the folks portrayed in the movie by most accounts of the time both mr were basically good and decent men their families were respectable people as were most of the people who lived in city br br by the way why is so hard for those who live outside of the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in alabama and why do they assume that everyone living in a small southern town is a racist my parents lived there and yet they didn't tolerate it in our household others didn't tolerate it either but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives on through the <UNK> ignorance of others br br the movie itself is simple and direct it isn't the whole story hollywood added a certain sensationalism when the film was made parts of it were absolutely on target other parts of it bordered on fairy tales and if it's the source that anyone uses to decide how folks in small southern towns are they need to get a grip and understand what most of us do it's only a movie","until later on br br the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting which makes its two hour running time unforgivable it's also not even remotely scary or creepy supposedly scary scenes like shots of <UNK> faces are done incredibly poorly shown twice or worse we are told when they are about to happen other techniques such as telling us that a family just interviewed died five days later simply don't make me care let alone mildly creeped br br the film does pick up a bit towards the end as our reporter cameraman psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to the curse which is linking all these deaths however by that time i was in a state of catatonic boredom and couldn't care less so all the fairly creepy camera work and shocks were wasted on me the final tape is quite good but once again i'd given up caring and just wanted this film to end br br boring and dull not scary and not creepy i would advise you keep away from it has promising

avoid this one at all costs my basic question is being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio columbia was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors this movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant joe de rita despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly shemp or even joe <UNK> if that's who moe and larry had left to pick from they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier always leave them laughing is the <UNK> for comedy and always quit while you're on top hence <UNK> leaving the sitcom while right up there instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline","are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime other examples are claude documentary <UNK> and come and see by the director's

extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian collaborators <UNK> that it was hardly ever seen in the ussr and of course post soviet russia has very little interest in films of that era br br the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the <UNK> era i e probably c 1988 however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here br br as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you haven't seen it your best chance

out although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience i actually remembered it because it was so bad it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies ie spielberg and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public but crap like this just totally killed the entire process","not effective at all br br this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the lamest killers ever he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie rating 2 10","whatsoever it

his 50's that had a beautiful virgin teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be insane not to take advantage of her it's too bad that the censorship board back when this

violence whereas guinea pig could easily be accused of this but one can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such
