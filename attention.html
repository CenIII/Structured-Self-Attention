to get it on vhs being a big gloria <UNK> fan it was an excellent addition to my collection other than that i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture the plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department ms <UNK> is always fun to watch if you like her as i do but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot she works in a dive so let her use her own voice it can only lend to the atmosphere i must agree with an earlier reviewer the ending borrows heavily from the big heat to the point of <UNK> from the ending i have seen worse films with ms <UNK> <UNK> but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie enjoy the picture","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> for all intents and purposes <UNK> might seem like just another lightweight bollywood musical to some extent this might even be true especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses but somewhere behind the scenes either <UNK> who had the <UNK> for this story or who directed the film decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations br br this is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women <UNK> on whom to choose as his life's partner dev <UNK> character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times and they with him despite being aware of the other two dev <UNK> relationship with <UNK> and is particularly interesting in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily there are quite a lot of suggestive <UNK> in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity the theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was <UNK> that the ending was tame obviously designed to please the masses and <UNK> criticism","<PAD> <PAD>

compelling and its political insights which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with are shallow and clunky and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today despite the fact it's coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario the drama as such is not very dramatic and the comedy is not funny the only points of interest really are seeing how new yorkers live their lives and the loyalty of a cast and crew to a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988 sometimes it seems like altman's sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once

cheers days with cable and internet nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face please bring back vegas i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did at least they had a two hour series final hey cbs are you listening please pick up vegas it is a great show","where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical water babies from an evil shark br br based on a book by charles kingsley this is a lovely children's film half live action and half animation which is both a grim and evocative depiction of victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable <UNK> adventure it really is two films in one which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole the animation by tony cuthbert jack and is wonderful as is the photography by ted and the music by phil <UNK> and bill martin has a great rough diamond quality as the literal fish out of water i love the moment when he's on top of the mansion sees all the <UNK> and shouts <UNK> at the top of his voice mason

we never see how or why they go to back to <UNK> dove which is a dirt hole in the original why would they ever leave austin where they are hero's for doing nothing during the whole movie i was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast there is no warning about how many segments there are it just ends this mini series could have been somebody tragic it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the <UNK>","reason we cut some slack to bogart in casablanca or nicholson in something's gotta give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters and by the time they deliver the line we're so deeply involved with their plight we don't even notice the cheese factor since wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists all we're left with a <UNK> sandwich and a few <UNK> in the audience br br wolfe takes the old hollywood director's phrase cut to the chase much too literally here as each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast the viewer is left wondering if director wolfe is <UNK> saying to the audience c'mon it's a richard gere romance just buy in br br it is as a result of this stunning lack of character or relationship development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts when <UNK> character dies i felt like i was watching the news about someone i didn't know passing away or watching a ladies' <UNK> <UNK> race during the <UNK> olympics just didn't care br br epic fail","group meanwhile the younger daughter chloe grace makes a

who's not a blood relative br br this movie was directed by j s <UNK> whose previous films include the slayer 1981 and 1990 two movies i didn't like in the slightest bit this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie the film is deliberately paced which i liked this allows you to get to know the main characters most of whom are likable child zombies have been used at least since george romero's 1968 classic night of the living dead still i found the tool using child zombies in this movie interesting it would seem that <UNK> finally found the right script and cast only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to me br br taylor <UNK> also appears in the halloween remake appeared in the amityville horror 2005 and

reveal herself to walter the young student in the <UNK> who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that

message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal message seems to be <UNK> careful what you go looking for for you just might find it ' i will say this for cannibal <UNK> when gloria comes back and writes her dissertation <UNK> that cannibalism does not

discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end frankly i never thought margaret <UNK> character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run lying to police covering up etc could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma

everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many <UNK> regulars appear in this film so it's not like there was a lack of on screen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was a comedic edge to this movie i certainly couldn't find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie","lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have br br some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film much as familiarity with shakespeare's the tempest would help with peter greenaway's dense <UNK> books these two films actually have a bit in common although princess <UNK> is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it br br while the art design acting and direction are fine for most of the film it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience br br this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars","as one story is concluded and another started the scenes within the film become disjointed another <UNK> for the movie version of a tv series is the inevitable comparisons that are made in this respect the film pales in comparison to rising brilliant series despite all this rising <UNK> the movie manages to be entertaining and occasionally uproarious it is perhaps not surprising that the finest moments occur during sequences written specially for the film this includes a <UNK> match where does a brilliantly timed <UNK> indeed while all the cast handle their roles perfectly bar a sub standard replacement actor for the late and truly great beckinsale it is leonard as that shines the most in fact rising <UNK> should have been made as a film just so could have been eligible for an oscar such is the magnificence of his acting talent criminally he wasn't even nominated ultimately the film fails to match the giddy heights of the tv series while managing to hold its own as a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments recommended viewing br br one last thing the opening

their college so they start up their own and of course call it h o t s it's a fun movie that is just bursting with drive in nostalgia lots of fully endowed t shirts vans fighting and a football game showdown like no other it's been compared to animal house which is a good movie in it's own right but to me nothing compares to h o t s it has it's own brand of fun character if you are looking for a classic t movie look no further because the h o t s girls are to the rescue boom boom shorts all","of his latest victim via chainsaw <UNK> machine and hungry <UNK> touch of death starts promisingly enough but fulci soon loses control of proceedings introducing a weird sub plot involving a mysterious <UNK> killer and some heavy handed scenes there are several more graphic murders which in true fulci fashion are extremely violent and gruesome but even the high level of <UNK> doesn't stop this from being one of fulci's poorer efforts br br as i have found with many of his other movies a <UNK> storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when lucio is behind the camera this film has many <UNK> which left me more than little perplexed why didn't lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured what the hell is that ending all about br br fulci is considered by many to be one of the of horror

out for the screenplay it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better unfortunately it only got worse <UNK> in a really retarded ending br br that's not to say everything about the movie is bad the cg is acceptable in a 1990's <UNK> sort of way which i assume is what they were going for and i suppose you can't go wrong with people getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place","the great success of this movie br br cynthia rhodes is great in her role of penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film the other members of the supporting cast <UNK> and the late mark <UNK> deserve a special mention here also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience the dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved br br the script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion the plot although exceedingly predictable is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful br br furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes br br dirty <UNK> is a truly powerful magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves

this one and it was a joy to see them and the greatest of them all richard was as tremendous as ever br br there is actually a plot that <UNK> along very nicely there's also some splendid jokes and comedic moments but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it alastair sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot big <UNK> <UNK> could be the headmistress of a girl's boarding school george cole <UNK> reid and irene all have their moments but with alastair and richard the star of the show is joyce she is an absolute one off and brings a smile whenever she's on the screen her rolling walk and plum accent done to perfection br br and for those playing the that's <UNK> game you can even spot arthur barbara windsor and ronald if you look carefully","come across any less likable i was rooting for him to get caught without sympathy for the main character this kind of show would never work finally this is supposed to be science fiction just because everyone is left handed and someone has hung three fake looking <UNK> on the horizon i'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet so it's a mere coincidence that they all speak english dress just like people on earth and drive <UNK> <UNK> yeah right br br the lone highlight for me was the inclusion of cameron mitchell in the cast sure it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful but you know the old saying any cameron is better than no cameron yeah i've never heard it either br br as with a lot of these 70s made for tv movies i watched stranded in space courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 i wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination but there are a few good jokes along the way so in the end while i rate the movie a 2 10 it gets a 3 5 on my mst3k rating scale","music when there is music is distracting instead of adding to the movie br br the direction is laughable goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke especially during times when there is supposed to be tension like in the middle of gun battles the writing is terrible there are some subplots that make no sense and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations the writer director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam but none of it makes sense these top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing br br the production values are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it if you like laughing at really poorly done student films then this movie is for you otherwise avoid this movie","while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s or patrick <UNK> sea saga the <UNK> of basic human condition lies at its center br br narrator <UNK> as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict surely not even dickens could beat that one alternates between <UNK> <UNK> and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as well br br the most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a man of war en route to australia in the early 1800's is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced <UNK> de <UNK> in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming br br this is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean some effort must be <UNK> in <UNK> an understanding of its nuances","is ponderous and gaudy the acting for the most part is terrible i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting but he must have been <UNK> when he saw the final cut of the movie john gielgud brief his appearance in the movie still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played <UNK> was handsome the guy who played <UNK> looked more like the traditional depictions of <UNK> and was certainly at odds with robert <UNK> picture of <UNK> the climactic assassination of <UNK> wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open air area when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the hill which ran along the front of the that still exists today there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it <UNK> distractions if you want history read or if you want pornography and sadism watch <UNK> but by all means stay away from this movie","a culprit br br the film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning with a gritty dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal the acting performances are among the best in italian horror cinema <UNK> one of my personal all time favorite actors is excellent in the lead as journalist andrea who is investigating the crimes sexy barbara bouchet delivers both eye candy and a brilliant performance equally outstanding performances come from irene papas and florinda <UNK> who is utterly brilliant in her role the great score by <UNK> <UNK> brilliantly <UNK> the suspense and atmosphere and the film is <UNK> shot in fascinating <UNK> landscapes although not as gory as many other fulci films this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence with a few shockingly brutal scenes br br don't torture a duckling has everything brilliant horror requires this is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other fulci flicks but i assure that searching it will pay off any horror fan must see this personal favorite of mine and i highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this a masterpiece","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

first anne <UNK> the <UNK> mature lusts for the <UNK> wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference another man's wife at one point by james <UNK> who plays <UNK> older and wiser mountain man father figure directed by anthony mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart but even so you really don't need the indian menace

life with flashbacks and his stories i don't know how but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip

<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> frankly i'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews i'll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan <UNK> and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990's indicated br br as far as action suspense movies go this movie fails in nearly every respect the acting is ok i guess but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually <UNK> but then again judging from other reviews some were don't be fooled the script is a boring derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film and statham is a thoroughly dull actor br br not recommended","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm very bad acting low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno 23 years old playing a teenage indian <UNK> in love with an older man in his 50's she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita 1962 only a more innocent lolita she bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny <UNK> almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum falling all over this old man willing to give him anything as he plays it off like she's a <UNK> to him any man in his 50's that had a beautiful virgin teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be insane not to take advantage of her it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita the only reason why i gave

most of the people in this film are just not attractive and that's ok not everyone is pretty but your camera technique to stick the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it is filling your 47 tv is not enjoyable i had to put my hand up half the time to shield myself from the warts <UNK> bags under eyes and yellow teeth really i'm trying not to sound inhuman but pull the camera back so its not like total strangers are breathing in my face br br the camera work in this film is rank amateur level it's the kind of camera work you see

can't see what the big deal is about this thing","to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack there are four kids and dog and they run away from a

class i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie then there is some horse manure in the whole mix it was torture watching this movie then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying

missing his kid's little league games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her even <UNK> a child with a member of his singing group br br the only negative i had with the filmmakers was the <UNK> of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event the accidental death of his brother that tragedy was used as cop out for all ray's as an adult which is another example of a culture
