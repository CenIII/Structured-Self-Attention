who surprise surprise has turned into a psychopathic adult trust me guys i understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that'll never happen you know that kid who teased you in high school he's no terrorist he's probably an accountant br br oh and i must mention the cgi <UNK> <UNK> i think those were on par with the matrix movies and transformers bravo you guys bravo br br it seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the middle east hey an overly emotional friendship story will work this is one of the most shallow movies i've had the misfortune of seeing it poses as deep well but when you get right down to it it's nothing special br br unfortunately the core of america's audience will do what they're told and follow the it's about controversial material so it must be good way of thinking","it stars samuel l jackson christina ricci and also justin timberlake is featured in a role timberlake does good work much to my surprise i didn't expect it of him br br when you're lost and you can't find your way home that's the black snake moan br br the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways psychologically and emotionally damaged betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain br br samuel l jackson plays a blues singer musician whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother along with <UNK> a child he had hoped to have with her br br christina <UNK> character is a woman who was sexually abused when young this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac allowing men to treat her badly br br the story lies in the <UNK> of these two characters lives it is a love story but not a sexual love story between them the older black man and the young white woman br br it is different from most films hollywood <UNK> out br br i highly recommend it br br 10 stars","very gory ways by a <UNK> leather clad mystery killer br br the hideous david barton fx are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort of surrealistic quality same goes for the movie the dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other worldly you'll start to doubt your own sanity this film actually attempts to have a plot and three dimensional characters but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an ingmar bergman script and like any good bergman film this has a mature moral to <UNK> by any good party needs a proper guy girl ratio so there will be enough chicks to <UNK> your lizard see it for yourself or don't br br <UNK> the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye popping nude scenes unfortunately she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it br br score 3 out of 10","the

evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal message seems to be <UNK> careful what you go looking for for you just

vampires by colin wilson this is in my humble opinion one of the best pieces of sci fi horror to come out of the eighties the effects done by <UNK> still hold up by todays standards the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism br br the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low but for whatever reason it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well paced plot br br not to be over looked","this series however fortunately i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected twists and turns and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts herein in case there is any confusion let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything i've just said is coated in pure carefully <UNK> sarcasm the kind that flourishes and grows <UNK> when exposed to crap like this flick a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator whose only other credit in that field is a henry rooker film that wasn't well received the acting is average at best and i defy anyone to not find scottish computer woman come on seriously what is with that last name 's russian accent laughable and or irritating there is an attempt or two at <UNK> in this and they are reasonable the action isn't terrible cinematography and editing are fine the music is cool enough language is <UNK> if even that violence is fairly bloody i recommend this solely to fans of b movies and i will say that you can do worse than this 1 10","a pleasant film but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon it opens <UNK> in how an individual thinks and afterwards will change the person forever br br the first time i saw this film was in class and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to <UNK> my body and mind i felt devastated and somehow unreal as if i didn't exist it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame and she asked oh is that when you were messed up after seeing it and ran into me talking all strange about it i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day i was astonished br br in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake altering your own reality forever this film must be seen","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time br br the movie itself it so massively flawed it's pretty difficult to know where to start it's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together as were the director to say we need to tell this and we need to tell that there is a story unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it to say the least the plot changes in

everything was there to make a good entertaining easy to watch movie then everything felt in this religious jesus will save everyone brainwashing mode br br story start with 2 main characters 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con descendant attitude br br in a few words this movie goes from entertaining to

are excellent br br walter <UNK> not my favorite was nearly perfect and goldie hawn <UNK> was fabulous tender at times demanding then just plain goofy there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie br br that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of 20 year olds was amazing to watch she is effortless in her return to the screen at age 54 the supporting cast was great and the lines the lines are exquisite br br a top 5 romantic comedy of all time","hollywood sir aubrey would also champion the game of in southern california he would remain very much in demand in studios all over town right up to his death in 1948 br br the film's top billed star is marion davies best remembered today as the mistress of media mogul william randolph hearst the of hearst castle the most fabulous residence on the west coast she was actually a very talented pretty comedienne for a few years hearst attempted to make her the queen of mgm with her own production company a huge <UNK> dressing room but the studio already had several other queens dressler garbo shearer crawford and he eventually moved her to warner bros here miss davies gets a chance to joke clown and her scenes with sir aubrey are entertaining br br her love interest is played by ralph forbes a handsome young british actor who was just starting to find good films the trail of as the silent days ended he had all the qualities for major stardom but sadly it was not to be celebrity would come to ray milland here making one of his first screen appearances <UNK> doris lloyd also appear to advantage","of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage <UNK> and abortions is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and <UNK> development but that are needed to prevent child abuse is <UNK> development parallel to emotional growth these are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them as an artistic piece this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem the script progresses with extreme simplicity albeit some <UNK> but never pulling any punches to state its message although by today standards it is somewhat slow the photography is beautiful and it has scenes of great beauty the acting of the two protagonists varies from really awful in some scenes to marvelously innocent and credible in others pop music unlike most productions nowadays is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists overall this is a delightful piece even if the moral

apart","look into the lives and history of the <UNK> he has <UNK> his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about i was never big into scratching but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little and <UNK> in jokes for those who are experts themselves in this

command br br director mark can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that scottish cinema need not all be and or and scottish films can be fresh inventive and most of all a lot of god damn fun this film is scottish with a north east flavour to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact which adds to the charm of the piece although the budget

they left br br history however has <UNK> the band let the critics be damned the <UNK> left behind some of the best most polished and successful pop records of the decade yes they had plenty of help

want to see it again buy the dvd as soon as you can you won't regret it it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody the only <UNK> is that <UNK> <UNK> is too short it's a jewel it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed trust me","moves along fairly quickly only one too many chases after randy slow it down br br we even get george hayes clean <UNK> and playing two parts marvin black the <UNK> villain as well as the good citizen matt the mute who <UNK> via <UNK> messages having him play two opposite roles was a good idea but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast even for him as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally ah i'm fed up with this you can find george playing a vile vile double crossing villain in the serial the lost city 1934 br br i think this is the only <UNK> <UNK> film in which the title relates to or is mentioned in the film sally offers her hand to randy and says he's not alone anymore then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake <UNK> running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff br br not that bad considering everything but not that great either i'd really give it a 4 and a half","for carmen or maybe that was just the acting there were cheesy lines piled upon one and other satan and devil <UNK> everywhere amongst the millions of swear words i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was <UNK> with in literally every line maybe it was realistic in 19th century poverty stricken <UNK> but the story itself didn't need it br br the editing and camera work was dull and ordinary there was only one bit i actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly close up in mid air which lands on face that was good but the rest boring br br to conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing if you're a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story however only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to paz vega otherwise stick to the opera version even though i hate musicals i give this film 4 just for

10 stars out of 10 stars if you are looking for a gore fest don't look here but if you want chills sent down your back see this one there are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but it leaves you

punch the best of the shorts are the honeymoon and people can lick too i enjoyed both as they have nice suspense throughout each story the was a good ghost story and the wrap around the campfire is pretty good too except they go for one too many twists at the end the only disappointing segment is the hook which is fine because it's pretty short anyway overall i give this a 7 out of 10 it has
