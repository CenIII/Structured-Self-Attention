picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer <UNK> score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending br br spoilers br br although i really like the character of and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he won't go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there's always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it <UNK> the film a little but as it stands it's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> i am a 58 year old man on a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we go see the women after reading the reviews i thought it might lead to an afternoon nap wrong this movie held my interest from start to finish it was great to finally see meg ryan looking super again let's face it meg looks much better with long hair annette <UNK> looked different to me in every scene she was in candice bergen is showing her age as is carrie fisher the daughter molly was exceptionally acted by young india i was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech cloris leachman and the woman from finland were terrific as the <UNK> who extend their regular duties the nyc scenes were nice to see oh and bette midler had a short role but as usual was terrific so i gave this chick flick a 9 guys go see this even just for the eye candy like eva mendes it won't disappoint","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

probably much better when watched under the influence but it is not good at all one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies the film is sad not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast if it were redone and written over it could be awesome if you want a good movie to see stoned watch <UNK> boy or half baked or dazed and confused but this is not a movie to be seen at all","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

i know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late '90s and early <UNK> but come on you have a <UNK> a buzz kill and an over <UNK> this show really made women look bad i cannot stand <UNK> analyzing every little thing on this show and that's what really killed it for me also <UNK> whining about her nonexistent <UNK> made my ears hurt and <UNK> cynicism was a complete buzz kill i mean can't she just be happy samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching there was also a good episode when nathan lane was on the show but that was the only one worth watching the rest of them were pretty much the same the humor was <UNK> than a bucket of sand and not very interesting plot line all in all not a very good show and i'm glad it's over","reveals that the system works just fine so quit your <UNK> br br while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy it all turns out to be a red herring before that becomes clear though gives some good lines to scott as his middle aged middle class white male stand in br br bitter alcoholic impotent scott's dr herbert has alienated those who know him best and he has the <UNK> to keep alienating them in <UNK> all that of course makes a <UNK> for a hippie chick half his age br br playing a collection of <UNK> the long haired long legged and almost bust less diana <UNK> struggles in the part of the girl ' the british <UNK> is miscast as a <UNK> free spirit but any other actress would struggle as well like the rest of a good cast gone to waste <UNK> can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except or any philosophy beyond banality br br for fans of george c scott this is another star turn and worth watching for fans of black comedy turn it off after the first 45 minutes for anyone else don't bother","truly looking to learn about another countries history watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really abusing their power to make it even worse the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with regime she decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to <UNK> but this is not surprising because both the director and the cia are violating the <UNK> of peru by trying to affect the democratic <UNK> at very different levels of course br br if the director was really interested in helping peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary in any case there are numerous peruvian made documentaries films and books about the subject such include <UNK> que no <UNK> <UNK> de santiago las <UNK> de la etc the director of the fall of should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations","themselves into cages a man carrying a gun laughs a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal god this is boring cut to the interior of the airport two men meet <UNK> something is happening they shake hands cut to a different angle of the two men br br and the director crosses the line br br the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of <UNK> relationship with each other and the guy has <UNK> up 'not crossing the <UNK> is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience audiences don't like to be confused mystified baffled puzzled and intrigued yes audiences love all of those confused no you loose them they walk out 'not crossing the <UNK> is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should it's basic stuff it's not an <UNK> rule there are no <UNK> rules directors break it all the time but not on the first real cut of the movie br br i thought i've seen enough and switched off","a tool of some sort br br he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers can't put together 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show i can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubt br br if you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his <UNK> for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe <UNK> show is beloved by some of the at least i don't suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic","got paid for this because he looks he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer didn t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s fee gawd only knows i deserve it br br i disliked this movie a lot as if you t guessed and my main beef <UNK> t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be <UNK> but you ll be able to <UNK> a couple of rabid devil dogs it could of course be argued that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers

years and years before tina turner was singing we don't need another hero br br even the forced <UNK> of the ending is <UNK> done in a dilapidated part of paris and rather chilly bare <UNK> apartment with only the couples love for each other to see them through as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night br br from this it was just a short step to wages of fear and the ultimate in despair br br they don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the u s for that matter they didn't even know how to very much in france then much less now the relentless detail of gesture makes even the of italy look like bad <UNK> which i guess makes <UNK> a kind of <UNK> on speed br br very enjoyable nonsense this movie the only flaw seems to me and as was pointed out by another viewer the lead woman is somehow not quite right everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> to paraphrase the previous <UNK> comments if you're a stooges fan avoid this one at all costs my basic question is being the experienced troopers of comedy that moe and larry were why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio columbia was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors this movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard moe and larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant joe de rita despite his background in vaudeville is just not up to the job as a replacement for curly shemp or even joe <UNK> if that's who moe and larry had left to pick from they should have just closed up shop and enjoy their retirement years leaving us fans with better memories of far better films they had done earlier always leave them laughing is the <UNK> for comedy and always quit while you're on top hence <UNK> leaving the sitcom while right up there instead of sticking around for the inevitable decline","10 dir billy wilder spectacular rendering of famous flight by james stewart as <UNK> and director billy wilder there isn't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what <UNK> went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before which is amazing there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age i appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself well done throughout this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

a real bully this was because he got julie in trouble with principal <UNK> eugene <UNK> if you ask me colonel <UNK> michael ironside was a pure a this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't

fans of hilary <UNK>","if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to well other than the unfunny jokes i think this one was in the clear well the unfunny jokes and the strange scene where the look a like ernest hits on a girl so yes ernest gets thrown in jail thanks to a look a like and proceeds to try to escape and there is other stuff to it like him becoming at one point shooting electricity and in a very painful to watch finale flying there are a couple of jokes but nothing to much to mention except for the gun carved from soap i think that is the only scene me or my friend's mother laughed out loud at this and camp are the only two ernest movies i have ever seen and from what i have seen in them i am not going to track down the other films ernest was good in small doses but a movie is just to much even when it is as short as this one i figure though the films made money mainly because all you need is <UNK> and a location and a theme and you have your

main <UNK> her acting level is just like <UNK> play so as most of other actors in the movie also zombies very bad acting as well and the story itself has really no point at all well if you are really

amazing thing about this film is a cinematography it is just so breath taking how they captured every beauty of landscapes yes each scene is like a work of <UNK> painting and the script is perfect too it mainly deals a deeper meaning of what makes a true artist for example kim <UNK> to jang in the movie that <UNK> one holds a <UNK> one has to set an aim in life' this is very moving and inspiring

him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable he by <UNK> that nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he can't show her who he really is she and then him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up br br funny things happen with the coach but <UNK> relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were perplexing matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back folks he isn't the right size he's fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to <UNK> his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right","not effective at all br br this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the lamest killers ever he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the

and turn on the rights for the right reasons for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch but in tourist trap prepare yourself that's not the case with it's perfect use of lighting <UNK> and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out plus i love because although they may go a bit over the top with some things you still feel like this could happen which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do and that is make us the audience feel <UNK> and terrified br br overall as far as any major problems go i have none only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times however in the end tourist trap holds a place near and dear to my heart for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on

script by tim pope there are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes the film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere there's no graphic gore in it a few splashes of blood here and there and thats <UNK> lot there's a bit of nudity but like the gore not much the acting is pretty strong especially and the photography is flat and unexciting and i can't even remember what the music was like the twist ending is great but it just takes far too long to get to it a film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget ok i guess but i think it would have worked a lot better if the story

this movie redone in the future since most old movies are being re made nowadays","good or action packed as the first mainly because this one in australia only had a pg instead of an m which is a pg 13 us or 12 uk but i was wrong thankfully the animation was more improved although some drawings of the characters at points looked rushed and was very good especially in the fight scenes br br speaking of that let's talk about the fight scenes the animation and action in the fight scenes was spectacular and very entertaining i especially enjoyed the battle with and the fight with fighting the shape shifting female warriors all the characters you want are here <UNK> sakura and if only was in the movie could save her from the female warriors in dramatic fashion and maybe they could have a passionate kiss in my summary at the top i say that this more as a piece of cinema than just an extended episode and it does the action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy

his part as father of the working class household is not at all bad br br not really recommendable for other audiences even spanish speakers in latin america the themes are all too related to a

it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like similar to <UNK> <UNK> writing i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this isabelle <UNK> is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi layered character there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well with so much disregard for their own reputation or image there is this <UNK> distance cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness hurt and pain there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear i think it's an excellent

anyways the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid performances the always beautiful and stunning <UNK> brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such

sad the two little sisters through flashbacks","beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the jews and the beautiful around the catholics br br although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act the oh so serious trial between <UNK> and antonio irons adds a bit of humor when collins and <UNK> come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated that in itself might not be funny but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing the whole cross dressing scene as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director michael <UNK> taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized the director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men which

script will without a doubt fall in love with this movie br br don't expect pretentious artistic wannabe crap like the version of r j with claire danes and leo dicaprio this one knows its a silly movie and draws its humor from that the acting is also surprisingly good and you can just feel sammy pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head br br the soundtrack which contains many original and high energy bands like the wesley willis fiasco <UNK> and the is also four star this movie should be viewed by all because it remains faithful to the original story while still being jam

is pathetically lame there is not one funny clever or witty line there is not one good sight gag br br the directing is terrible comedy relies on timing someone should tell the director that every line that is supposed to be funny and isn't is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i've ever seen br br 0 stars","much from the <UNK> plot as from the relationship between the characters the film tells two stories in parallel br br the first story involves the characters played by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> drifter with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness who is followed by a naive young man played by <UNK> with plenty of good natured smiles many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters for example when <UNK> tries to teach <UNK> how to be intimidating br br the second story tells how a salesman played by jean gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony i wish i could describe this better br br after a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end in a surprising but also logical ending br br the film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director's father the celebrated michel audiard used to write and the typical french film with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions","to see if the show is actually worth something what if the show isn't trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction it even fails on that level as well if the show's creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full horrifying glory the writing is simply not compelling and even dare i say boring strike three br br so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary thats all the show is at this point there is no reason to see it not even for the

this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother she seemed very believable and to me very likable and while it is a little and over the top its good overall i gotta say if the horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this but if you like horror films or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things 8 0 out of 10 stars","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated there is the token guy who

humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with and feet with traditional wing tips drinks too much and plays by his own rules as you might have guessed the only other funny moments are shooting many many people and spending time at home in the bathroom it is not funny but it is worth a look","treat her of the

if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't

acceptance of the end of life in a <UNK> individual and convincing performance because his character was close to death the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us the

expecting a highly charged climax such as the meeting of two long separated elderly lovers who were also on the <UNK> of death in forever young i wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest i was delighted to find that the story brought more than i expected the delightfully satisfying
