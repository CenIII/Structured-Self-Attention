bereft of feelings as the old one there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is 'i don't <UNK> br br in fact much of what the bothersome man has to say has been said before and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating over and over again an <UNK> life is one that is not worth living added to which it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls more than one character reminded me of people i've known especially his furniture obsessed girlfriend and if by the end of the film the film makers have run out of ideas maybe that's the point there will no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

all in all it is fun to watch br br but the ending i feel is completely botched it left me bewildered yes you expect people crossing and double crossing each other in this sort of movie but <UNK> crossing well if it's justified by the plot then why not br br but that's the bad part there's completely no need for it after a certain point it's all scheming with completely no meaning here comes the spoiler after the airport scene enrico and his <UNK> already have the money i couldn't understand the need for the rest of the scam is it all necessary just to rub nose in the fact that he's been fooled i don't buy it br br so 6 out of 10 for 3 4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the ending","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

trafficking in europe this is the european produced pbs series on which the oscar nominated movie traffic is based on if you loved traffic then is a must see br br overall i would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view the screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers <UNK> farmers and police officers unlike other movies that <UNK> the issue of drugs presents it as is","chad muska and maybe some more <UNK> the game doesn't have mike v or bam dang well anyway the gameplay is awesome the level school ii is a great level with so much to <UNK> in career mode you collect <UNK> get money get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes there's create a skater which is pretty cool i created a skater named butt mulligan a black guy with an afro and a girl board there's park editor some cool <UNK> parks free <UNK> and there's single session where you <UNK> for 2 minutes and get a score you can watch <UNK> which is always cool each skater has 2 styles a and b the graphics aren't that good well they're good for an n64 game i wish i had a controller pack so i could save my data overall this game is awesome i give it an 8 10 for n64 but with the version it's just as fun as the n64 version but kinda hard to control i give it a 7 10 for so go out to a place that still sells n64

apocalypse movie scale is this piece of <UNK> called 'the final at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an ex cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and that's about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a <UNK> and is about to be <UNK> through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier it's a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i'm still puzzling over that one myself now 2 10","whenever you see a puppet the camera is always <UNK> above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along that's as complex state of the art as the special effects get br br the one positive thing that retro puppet master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice the period production design costumes props are actually quite impressive it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times apparently filmed in <UNK> in romania which doubles up quite nicely for turn of the last century paris the acting here is awful maybe the worst of the series br br retro puppet master is more or less the final puppet master film as the next one puppet master the legacy 2004 basically edits together footage from the previous seven films it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent distinctive little killer puppet flicks don't bother with this just watch one of the first three again just remember the good times the killer puppets would return in the terrible spin off flick puppet master vs demonic toys 2004","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

that she is truly the best actress in film today very entertaining and just what i expected don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally but if you have that expectation then you will enjoy the ride","was completely modern and <UNK> br br here we have billie piper who looks like a pretty country wench she has a charming personality that develops nicely but she has <UNK> died blonde hair with black eyebrows and through much of the pic dark brown roots so much for <UNK> cousin it is incredibly distracting and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair <UNK> clothing genre that shows a real disrespect for period accuracy br br one thing is good here haley is the best mary crawford of all the versions she is note perfect flirtatious without being at all modern or suggestive flippant and completely without any moral or ethical compass henry here is actually good looking enough to be a slight temptation for our heroine br br redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her actually boring until her last scene much too sensible this is just a production that really missed the mark a real low for austen fans br br the only serviceable version is the one with odd duck perfect for the role la despite the very very gay henry crawford he's just laughable","not effective at all br br this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears he has to be one of the lamest killers ever he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense he was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer in the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie rating 2 10","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists however with that said i was really disappointed in ending in my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told br br you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open br br overall though this movie was very well made and unlike similar movies such as <UNK> all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top","stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest this is 96 1 2 minutes of sleep inducing material probably jim worst movie ever the last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for on the other hand if you are a die hard jim <UNK> ernest fan then like me you must add this film to your collection it does have brief rare moments of humor although they are few and far between the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collectors item and a must have for your ernest collection i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago i believe i paid 1 99 plus <UNK> for it and it was the only copy i could find anywhere even though this is a truly all around horrible movie it is still a must have if you are a jim <UNK> fan and an ernest movie collector such as i on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this movie a 2 but thats only because i've never seen a 1 before","lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have br br some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film much as familiarity with shakespeare's the tempest would help with peter greenaway's dense <UNK> books these two films actually have a bit in common although princess <UNK> is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it br br while the art design acting and direction are fine for most of the film it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience br br this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

better ending there is flashes of brilliance in this movie the boat ride scene burt driving the mean machine and his chat with his parents you can tell burt is a <UNK> and not a actor this movie shows what gator would be like <UNK> best film too bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the rush 4 10","knows his trade very well and <UNK> brings to life an artificial world avoiding the usual pitfalls and clichés linked to stories such as this the film shows some pretty disgusting stuff but is unusually low key in the gore department in comparison to other work the shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative it's not the most intellectual movie ever but it will leave you thinking about it wondering and pretty confused br br the acting gets two thumbs up as well both protagonists jennifer jason leigh and jude law play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities the dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times but that is part of the effect <UNK> was going for to create a <UNK> and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease supporting actors as ian holm don <UNK> and an especially creepy willem dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances br br this movie takes some getting used to but if you can appreciate the dark tone blood imagery and <UNK> <UNK> story you'll love it","quality they had earlier br br <UNK> main hoon released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were <UNK> mostly except hum 1991 later in 1991 br br this is another of the crap amitabh films people rejected in early 90's br br the film he did like a friendship token to <UNK> kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny the film also had <UNK> and <UNK> again not paired each other after br br the film came in 1991 when bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them br br came 2 years after <UNK> and both supernatural films which were rejected this is another type of crap bachchan wears a mask and a type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey etc of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched br br direction by <UNK> kapoor is not good music is bad br br amongst actors amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired his acting is okay but not on par with his best <UNK> is okay <UNK> is alright rest are forgettable","scarlet letter and now here she is in the power and the glory giving a performance of staggering power working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors spencer tracy br br i found the movie a little lack <UNK> story wise but moore and tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make up and hair changes moore is almost <UNK> as the elderly wife and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes i have ever seen she does most of the scene without dialogue which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge even over tracy contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and tracy is struggling to <UNK> to her astonishing what this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement","a tool of some sort br br he is a hack comedian who even with a staff of writers can't put together 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show i can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy not too surprisingly he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubt br br if you ever see the greats jerry seinfeld chris rock jon stewart etc talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice all that work was completely skipped by mencia his comedic voice is in part stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his <UNK> for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe <UNK> show is beloved by some of the at least i don't suck that badly crowd who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic","documentary is two fold by a slow <UNK> discovery of the world <UNK> architect we get to know 1 his ideas buildings and the <UNK> perspective and 2 his families <UNK> people's life he affected and the human perspective br br the dvd also offers added insight with a q a with the writer director and additional footage that includes such great louis i khan quotes as everything that everybody says is the truth it's their truth it might not be factual and a good idea that doesn't happen is no idea at all br br this movie is a journey of discovery self discovery and discovery of a man a great man yet a human imperfect like all of us we get to know him through the eyes of an admiring and slightly bitter son but with the <UNK> and <UNK> to really explore without making easy conclusions and without judging br br by key interviews with people who <UNK> with him in various capacity we slowly put some pieces together until that final interview with this man from <UNK> who really seems to bring it back home with visceral and sensible comments br br brilliant architect brilliant documentary","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

and i like matt dillon i thought he came close to looking a little like hank but mostly just the <UNK> i have to care about a character though and there just wasn't much here to care about i think time might be cruel to <UNK> and that bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time hard to sit through scenes that went nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit i ask for very little got less","it was entirely predictable bitch girls pick on outcast outcast wants to know why they hate her so much bitch girls die a terrible death outcast girl goes home and looks crazy outcast girl brought evil spirits with her makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other creepy kid understands what's going on oh and the younger sister not being good enough for <UNK> sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home br br to be fair there were some great moments here and there first of all sarah michelle character dies in the first few minutes definite plus didn't see that one coming i didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head either if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills i would have loved it the beginning showed so much promise br br i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one it made me jump i didn't expect most of what happened and though i questioned some of the movie it was still a fun watch i didn't watch any previews for this the sequel because i wanted to be surprised i was but in the wrong direction","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers threw them in a <UNK> and used what came out for the screenplay it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better unfortunately it only got worse <UNK> in a really retarded ending br br that's not to say everything about the movie is bad the cg is acceptable in a 1990's <UNK> sort of way which i assume is what they were going for and i suppose you can't go wrong with people getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <START> i went out of my way to get this film and was fortunate to get it on vhs being a big gloria <UNK> fan it was an excellent addition to my collection other than that i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture the plot is predictable and weak and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department ms <UNK> is always fun to watch if you like her as i do but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot she works in a dive so let her use her own voice it can only lend to the atmosphere i must agree with an earlier reviewer the ending borrows heavily from the big heat to the point of <UNK> from the ending i have seen worse films with ms <UNK> <UNK> but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film this is your movie enjoy the picture","story changes in the original martha is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country br br the american martha is softer and therefore the movie is <UNK> and does not have that edge the german movie has br br in the original the italian cook is not so good looking but much more charming the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and martha is more representative of a career woman in today's world than the watered down version we are presented in the american version and the whole opera music in the american version was very annoying i loved the italian songs in the original and bought the cd br br hollywood recognized that mostly martha was a great movie maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in english without subtitles in any case the original is so much better by the way this reminds me of another remake shall we dance is one of my favorites in the original japanese version and totally forgettable in the american version","of sanctimonious self righteousness but brilliantly there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set and mercifully much of <UNK> part is cut br br the text is quite stripped down with many passages cut but i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it and it was replaced by a look that said it all this economy and judicious editing has given us a gripping movie not just a film of the play br br and at last there is a rationale as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the <UNK> unrelated you can almost feel <UNK> pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of passing by in a <UNK> or arriving for a visit but it is as subtle as that no more i was spellbound br br there were many other highlights i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking and the trials are hilarious br br add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with the times and you'll understand why i can't wait to see it again and again","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

searching for it for more than 10 years this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane continuous jokes <UNK> funny actions mark <UNK> is absolutely hilarious his transformation from the shy dr daniel jekyll into the sex crazed mr hyde is unforgettable complete with and the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woo's totally psychedelic experience without the drugs if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it when i first seen it i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing this is a

innocent and critical at once something with dance br br but we missed it like kong bending a the revolution was turned in on itself into sexism racism homophobia and class crushing politics until we

seeing the pretty children not even the home improvement boy getting <UNK> in this movie's climactic scene and it's so unnecessarily gory there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym br br

faces started to kill me and that was very often it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly stroke pigs and french kiss men not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex if only it made any sense the whole murder situation is ridiculous seems like it was only created to show one more vagina since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer and that makes no <UNK> either despite all the boredom and

feel to the whole film too br br with a supposed budget of about 1 000 000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to

problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures ranging from a one arm man beating a horse to a toothless soldier

colorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto <UNK> chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through <UNK> is like dreamlike sometimes

demographic i don't know what it is aimed for i found the plot everyday boring it's something that i would do and trust me it's not worth filming going on a <UNK> and filming half of the silence does not make a movie","music when there is music is distracting instead of adding to the movie br br the direction is laughable goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke especially during times when there is supposed to be tension like in the middle of gun battles the writing is terrible there are some subplots that make no sense and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations the writer director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam but none of it makes sense these top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing br br the production values are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it if you like laughing at really poorly done student films then this movie is for you otherwise avoid this movie","before or never really listened to it i believe that much of the emotional impact of this film is due to and performances you root for their love to win out br br a minor quibble with the <UNK> minute running time one or two slow spot and a stereotypical amos n

4 which i'm guessing was his way of working with the wide screen br br and <UNK> has always been a cult film for those of us who saw it for those of us who loved the soundtrack and for some of us who

<UNK> they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power emotion and drama the story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace mostly taking place in a living room the director obviously moved the actors around in a circles as they delivered long lines to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience the action doesn't pick up until the last ten

this is the kind of neo con talking points about youth culture and the <UNK> of <UNK> thought tossed around by politicians today granted much of it was drivel pouring out then as well but it really shows us how little has changed and informs of how in some ways we are closer to such a world where punishment parks would be a real and frightening operation br br the main players in nearly every scene are seasoned non actors mostly chosen for their rash political views and desire to get them on camera this lends an unprecedented heap of authenticity to the entire experience as we never even for a second question the reality of all the chaos shot documentary style with 16mm film this appears like a gritty <UNK> of some despicable government test project that was classified until found

me not everyone will like it hence the relatively low rating on imdb but that's because it is not conventional hollywood rather it challenges the viewer on several levels i've never watched it without sobbing at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life","very gory ways by a <UNK> leather clad mystery killer br br the hideous david barton fx are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort of surrealistic quality same goes for the movie the dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other worldly you'll start to doubt your
